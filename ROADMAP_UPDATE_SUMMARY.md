## Roadmap Highlights

### What Works Today (October 8, 2025)

**✅ Complete:**
- Batch operator API (RecordBatch → RecordBatch)
- Auto-Numba UDF compilation (10-100x speedup)
- Morsel-driven parallelism (2-4x single-node)
- Network shuffle (zero-copy Arrow Flight)
- Hybrid state backends (Tonbo + RocksDB + Memory)
- 9 production-ready operators
- Performance: 0.15-729M rows/sec

### In Progress (40-50% complete)

**🚧 Partial:**
- Agent worker nodes (structure exists, needs wiring)
- DBOS control plane (design complete, partial implementation)
- Fault tolerance (primitives exist, not tested end-to-end)

### Planned (0% complete)

**📋 Future:**
- Window operators (tumbling, sliding, session)
- Plan optimization (filter/projection pushdown)
- SQL interface
- Advanced features (CEP, ML integration)

---

## Timeline (from new roadmap)

- Complete Phase 6 (DBOS control plane) - 1 week
- Start Phase 7 (optimization) - 1 week

**December:**
- Complete Phase 8 (windows) - 1.5 weeks
- Integration testing and examples

1. Complete Phase 5 (agent workers) - 2 weeks
2. Complete Phase 6 (DBOS control plane) - 1 week
3. Window operators - 1.5 weeks
4. Integration testing - 1 week

**Target Date:** End of November 2025

## Flink Parity Comparison

### Improved Areas (October 2 → October 8)

| Feature | Was (Oct 2) | Now (Oct 8) | Change |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Batch operators | 🔴 None | ✅ Complete | +100% |
| Stream operators | 🔴 None | ✅ Complete | +100% |
| State backends | 🟡 Partial | ✅ Complete | +50% |
| Network shuffle | 🔴 None | ✅ Complete | +100% |
| Auto-compilation | 🔴 None | ✅ Complete | +100% |
| Event-time | 🟡 Primitives | 🟡 Partial | +20% |
| Checkpointing | 🟡 Basic | 🟡 Basic | No change |
| Windowing | 🔴 None | 📋 Designed | +20% |

### Still Behind Flink

| Feature | Flink | Sabot | Gap |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|
| Cluster management | ✅ | 🚧 40% | 60% |
| Fault tolerance | ✅ | 🚧 60% | 40% |
| SQL interface | ✅ | 📋 0% | 100% |
| Web UI | ✅ | 📋 0% | 100% |
| Connector ecosystem | ✅ 30+ | 🟡 5 | Large |
| Production maturity | ✅ | 🚧 70% | 30% |

**Overall Flink Parity:** 50-60% (target: 80% by end of Q4 2025)

---

## Sabot Advantages Over Flink

1. **Python-native** - Not a JVM wrapper
2. **Simpler deployment** - No JVM overhead
3. **Hybrid storage** - Tonbo (columnar) + RocksDB (metadata)
4. **Auto-Numba** - Transparent UDF speedup
5. **Better DX** - Pythonic API, easier debugging
