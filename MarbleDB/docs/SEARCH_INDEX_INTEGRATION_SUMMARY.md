# Search Index Integration for MarbleDB - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** Research Complete, Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Effort:** 5 weeks (prototype to production)

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the research and implementation plan for adding **full-text search capabilities** to MarbleDB using Lucene-style inverted indexes.

**Goal:** Enable MarbleDB to handle hybrid workloads combining:
- **Analytical queries** (MarbleDB's strength): GROUP BY, aggregations, time-series
- **Full-text search** (new capability): MATCH queries, document retrieval, text search

---

## Research Summary

### What We Learned

1. **MarbleDB and Lucene are complementary systems:**
   - MarbleDB: Columnar storage optimized for OLAP (10x faster aggregations)
   - Lucene: Inverted indexes optimized for full-text search (10x faster text queries)

2. **Common architecture patterns:**
   - Both use immutable segments
   - Both use bloom filters for pruning
   - Both use segment merging/compaction
   - Both support distributed deployments

3. **Key architectural differences:**
   - **Storage:** Columnar (MarbleDB) vs Row-oriented documents (Lucene)
   - **Indexes:** Sparse index + zone maps (MarbleDB) vs Inverted index (Lucene)
   - **Query focus:** Analytical aggregations vs Text retrieval

4. **Opportunity for hybrid approach:**
   - Store **both** columnar data and inverted indexes in same segment
   - Enable queries that combine search + analytics
   - Single system instead of MarbleDB + Elasticsearch

---

## Use Cases Unlocked

### 1. Log Analytics with Search
```sql
-- Current: MarbleDB excels at this
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS error_count
FROM logs
WHERE timestamp > '2025-01-01'
  AND level = 'ERROR'
GROUP BY service

-- NEW: Add full-text search capability
SELECT service, timestamp, message
FROM logs
WHERE MATCH(message, 'database connection failed')
  AND level = 'ERROR'
  AND timestamp > '2025-01-01'
LIMIT 100
```

### 2. News Analytics
```sql
-- Hybrid query: Search + Aggregation
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) AS article_count, AVG(sentiment) AS avg_sentiment
FROM news_articles
WHERE MATCH(content, 'recession economy crisis')
  AND timestamp BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY article_count DESC
```

### 3. Document Store with Analytics
```sql
-- Full-text search
SELECT * FROM documents
WHERE MATCH(content, 'contract negotiation terms')
LIMIT 10

-- Analytical aggregation on results
SELECT category, AVG(word_count), COUNT(*)
FROM documents
WHERE MATCH(content, 'contract negotiation')
GROUP BY category
```

## Proposed Architecture

### Storage Layout

```
MarbleDB Segment (Enhanced):
├── Columnar Data (existing)
│   ├── id.parquet
│   ├── timestamp.parquet
│   ├── symbol.parquet
│   ├── content.parquet (original text)
│   └── sentiment.parquet
│
├── Indexes (existing)
│   ├── sparse_index (key → block offset)
│   ├── zone_maps (min/max per page)
│   └── bloom_filters (per block)
│
└── Inverted Index (NEW)
    ├── content_index.tip (term dictionary - FST)
    ├── content_index.doc (postings lists)
    ├── content_index.pos (positions for phrase queries)
    └── content_index.bloom (term bloom filter)
```

### Query Processing

**Hybrid Query Execution:**
```
Query: MATCH(content, 'iPhone decline') AND timestamp > '2025-01-01' GROUP BY symbol

1. [Inverted Index] Find doc IDs matching "iPhone decline"
   → Results: [123, 456, 789, ...] (~1-10ms)

2. [Zone Maps] Filter segments by timestamp > '2025-01-01'
   → Skip 80% of segments (~1ms)

3. [Intersection] Doc IDs that satisfy both conditions
   → Results: [123, 789, ...] (~1ms)

4. [Columnar Scan] Read symbol, sentiment columns for matching docs
   → Projection pushdown (~5ms)

5. [Vectorized Aggregation] GROUP BY symbol using SIMD
   → Fast aggregation (~10ms)

Total: ~20-50ms (3-5x faster than Lucene alone)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Inverted Index (2 weeks)

**Deliverables:**
- Tantivy FFI bindings (create/add/search)
- Simple tokenizer (whitespace + lowercase)
- Basic AND/OR queries
- Store inverted index in segment directory

**Code:**
```cpp
// C++ API
InvertedIndexBuilder builder("/path/to/index");
builder.AddDocument(123, "Apple reports strong earnings...");
builder.Commit();

InvertedIndexSearcher searcher("/path/to/index");
auto doc_ids = searcher.Search("strong earnings", 10);
```

**Testing:**
- 10K documents, simple queries
- Verify correctness (search results match)
- Measure latency (<10ms for simple queries)

---

### Phase 2: Text Analysis (1 week)

**Deliverables:**
- Stemming (Porter stemmer for English)
- Stop words removal (common words: "the", "a", "is")
- Language-specific analyzers (English, Spanish, etc.)
- Custom analyzer configuration

**Code:**
```cpp
// Configure text analysis
AnalyzerConfig config;
config.language = "english";
config.enable_stemming = true;
config.stop_words = {"the", "a", "an", "is", "are"};

InvertedIndexBuilder builder("/path/to/index", config);
```

**Testing:**
- Search "running" matches "run", "runs", "ran"
- Stop words excluded from index
- Language-specific analysis works correctly

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Queries (1 week)

**Deliverables:**
- Phrase queries: `"exact phrase match"`
- Fuzzy matching: `~levenshtein_distance`
- Boolean queries: `must AND (should OR should) AND NOT must_not`
- Field-specific search: `title:iPhone AND content:decline`

**Code:**
```cpp
// Phrase query
searcher.SearchPhrase("\"iPhone sales decline\"", 10);

// Fuzzy query (typo tolerance)
searcher.SearchFuzzy("iphne~2", 10); // Matches "iphone"

// Boolean query
BooleanQuery query;
query.must("iPhone");
query.should("sales").should("revenue");
query.must_not("decline");
auto results = searcher.Search(query, 10);
```

**Testing:**
- Phrase queries match exact phrases only
- Fuzzy queries handle typos (Levenshtein distance)
- Boolean logic correct (must/should/must_not)

---

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (1 week)

**Deliverables:**
- Bloom filters for term dictionary (skip non-existent terms)
- Skip lists for large posting lists (faster intersection)
- Compression: PFOR-DELTA encoding for doc IDs
- Query caching (LRU cache of recent queries)

**Performance Targets:**
- Simple search: <5ms for 1M documents
- Complex search (phrase + boolean): <20ms
- Indexing throughput: >1000 docs/sec
- Storage overhead: <30% of original data

**Testing:**
- Benchmark search latency (percentiles: p50, p95, p99)
- Benchmark indexing throughput
- Measure storage overhead
- Compare to Lucene baseline

---

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (1 week)

**Deliverables:**
- Integrate with MarbleDB table schema
- Add `MATCH()` SQL function
- Update segment format to include inverted index
- End-to-end hybrid query tests
- Documentation and examples

**Code:**
```cpp
// Create table with search-enabled column
auto schema = arrow::schema({
  arrow::field("id", arrow::int64()),
  arrow::field("timestamp", arrow::timestamp(arrow::TimeUnit::MICRO)),
  arrow::field("content", arrow::utf8())
});

TableSchema table_schema;
table_schema.name = "articles";
table_schema.arrow_schema = schema;
table_schema.inverted_index_columns = {"content"}; // NEW

db->CreateTable(table_schema);

// Query with MATCH()
auto results = db->Query(R"(
  SELECT id, timestamp
  FROM articles
  WHERE MATCH(content, 'iPhone sales decline')
    AND timestamp > '2025-01-01'
  LIMIT 10
)");
```

**Testing:**
- End-to-end tests (insert → search → verify)
- Hybrid query tests (search + filter + aggregation)
- Concurrency tests (multiple searches + inserts)
- Crash recovery (index consistency after restart)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: FFI Overhead

**Risk:** Rust FFI adds latency (~1-5ms per call)
**Mitigation:**
- Batch operations (add 100 docs at once)
- Cache search results
- Use zero-copy for large data transfers

### Risk 2: Text Analysis Complexity

**Risk:** Implementing stemmers, analyzers is complex
**Mitigation:**
- Use Tantivy's built-in analyzers (English, Spanish, etc.)
- Start with simple tokenizer, add advanced features later
- Leverage Rust ecosystem (rust-stemmers, etc.)

### Risk 3: Index Size

**Risk:** Inverted index adds 20-30% storage overhead
**Mitigation:**
- Compression (PFOR-DELTA for doc IDs)
- Selective indexing (only enable for specific columns)
- Tiered storage (hot index in memory, cold on disk)

### Risk 4: Query Complexity

**Risk:** Complex boolean queries may be slow
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize posting list intersection (skip lists)
- Bloom filters for early termination
- Query planner (reorder terms by selectivity)

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Hybrid Log Analytics Platform

**Current:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)
**Problem:** Slow aggregations, high memory usage, eventual consistency

**With MarbleDB:**
```sql
-- Fast full-text search
SELECT timestamp, service, message
FROM logs
WHERE MATCH(message, 'database connection timeout')
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
LIMIT 100

-- Fast analytics (10x faster than ES)
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS error_count
FROM logs
WHERE level = 'ERROR'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY service
ORDER BY error_count DESC

-- Hybrid query
SELECT service, AVG(response_time_ms) AS avg_latency
FROM logs
WHERE MATCH(message, 'slow query')
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY service
```

**Benefits:**
- 10x faster aggregations (columnar storage)
- Strong consistency (Raft replication)
- Lower memory usage (efficient storage)
- Single system (no Elasticsearch + ClickHouse)

---

### 2. Financial News Analytics

**Current:** Elasticsearch (search) + ClickHouse (analytics)
**Problem:** Data duplication, sync lag, complex architecture

**With MarbleDB:**
```sql
-- Search news articles
SELECT title, published_at, sentiment_score
FROM news_articles
WHERE MATCH(content, 'Federal Reserve interest rate')
  AND symbol = 'SPY'
ORDER BY published_at DESC
LIMIT 20

-- Sentiment trends (analytics)
SELECT DATE(published_at), AVG(sentiment_score) AS avg_sentiment
FROM news_articles
WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'
  AND published_at > '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE(published_at)

-- Hybrid: Search + analytics
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) AS mentions, AVG(sentiment_score)
FROM news_articles
WHERE MATCH(content, 'earnings beat expectations')
  AND published_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY mentions DESC
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth (no duplication)
- Real-time consistency (no sync lag)
- Faster hybrid queries (3-5x speedup)
- Simpler architecture (one system)

---

### 3. E-commerce Product Search + Analytics

**Current:** Elasticsearch (product search) + Warehouse (analytics)
**Problem:** Stale analytics, complex ETL, high costs

**With MarbleDB:**
```sql
-- Product search
SELECT product_id, name, price, description
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(description, 'wireless bluetooth headphones')
  AND category = 'Electronics'
  AND price < 100
LIMIT 20

-- Sales analytics
SELECT category, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM products JOIN sales USING (product_id)
WHERE sale_date > '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY category

-- Hybrid: Search + analytics
SELECT brand, COUNT(*) AS products, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(description, 'sustainable eco-friendly')
  AND stock_count > 0
GROUP BY brand
```

**Benefits:**
- Real-time analytics (no ETL lag)
- Unified product catalog (search + analytics)
- Lower costs (one system vs two)

---

## Conclusion

**MarbleDB + Full-Text Search = Best of Both Worlds**
