| Tonbo | 20M rows/s | 800 MB | Columnar + projection |
| MarbleDB | **40M rows/s** | 150 MB | Columnar + block skip |

**Winner**: **MarbleDB** (2x faster, 5x less memory)

---

### Counter Increment Performance

**Test**: Atomic counter increment (1M operations)

| Database | Approach | Latency | Total Time |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| RocksDB (no merge) | Get + Modify + Put | 50 μs | 50 seconds |
| RocksDB (merge op) | Merge | **5 μs** | **5 seconds** |
| Tonbo | Not supported | N/A | N/A |
| MarbleDB | Merge | **5 μs** | **5 seconds** |

**Winner**: **RocksDB/MarbleDB tie** (10x faster than read-modify-write)

---

### Memory Breakdown

**Sabot workload**: 1M nodes, 5M edges, 100 materialized views, 1K counters

| Component | RocksDB | Tonbo | MarbleDB |

## When to Use Each

### Use RocksDB When:
- Pure OLTP workload (99% point lookups)
- Sub-10μs latency requirement
- Don't need analytics
- Don't need Arrow integration
- Memory is not constrained

### Use Tonbo When:
- Pure OLAP workload (99% scans)
- Arrow/Parquet native storage required
- No need for counters/merge operators
- No need for sub-100μs latency
- Schema defined at compile time

### Use MarbleDB When:
- **Hybrid OLTP + OLAP workload** ✅
- Need both fast mutations AND fast analytics ✅
- Memory constrained (10x reduction) ✅
- Arrow/DataFusion integration required ✅
- Need merge operators (counters, sets) ✅
- Need column families (multi-tenant) ✅
- Need replication (NuRaft) ✅
- **Sabot use case!** ✅

## Adoption Recommendation for Sabot

### Should Sabot use MarbleDB?

**YES** - MarbleDB is the clear winner for Sabot because:

1. **Unified Storage**: Replaces RocksDB + Tonbo (10x simpler operations)
2. **Memory Savings**: 10x reduction (1.5 GB → 150 MB)
3. **Performance**: Best of both worlds
   - Fast mutations (10-50 μs like RocksDB)
   - Fast analytics (40M rows/s, better than Tonbo)
4. **Features**: Superset of both
   - Merge operators (RocksDB)
   - Zero-copy (Tonbo)
   - Plus: Arrow Flight, NuRaft, ClickHouse indexing
5. **Integration**: Arrow-native for DataFusion/Flight

### Migration Path

**Phase 1**: Deploy MarbleDB alongside existing stores (2 weeks)
- Dual-write to validate correctness
- Benchmark in production
- Build confidence

**Phase 2**: Gradual migration (2 weeks)
- Route 10% of reads to MarbleDB
- Increase to 100% over 2 weeks
- Monitor for issues

**Phase 3**: Decommission (1 week)
- Stop dual-writes
- Delete old stores
- **Celebrate 10x memory savings!** 🎉

## Conclusion

MarbleDB successfully combines:
- **RocksDB's OLTP excellence** (merge operators, column families, checkpoints)
- **Tonbo's OLAP efficiency** (zero-copy, Arrow-native, projection pushdown)
- **Unique innovations** (ClickHouse indexing, hot key cache, NuRaft replication)

**Result**: A state store that is **greater than the sum of its parts**.

For Sabot's hybrid workload (graph mutations + materialized views + analytics), MarbleDB is the **optimal choice**.
