# Shuffle Implementation for Operator Parallelism in Sabot

## Overview

Implemented complete shuffle system to enable operator parallelism in Sabot, allowing N upstream tasks to redistribute data to M downstream tasks based on partitioning keys.

## Architecture

Borrowed from **Spark**, **Flink**, and **Arroyo**:

- **From Spark**: Sort-based shuffle concept, external shuffle service pattern, spill-to-disk
- **From Flink**: Credit-based flow control, NetworkBufferPool with exclusive+floating buffers, pipelined execution
- **From Arroyo**: Arrow-centric design, hash partitioning with key ranges, zero-copy transport

**Adapted for Sabot**: All IPC in C++/Cython, leverages existing Arrow Flight infrastructure, Tonbo for spilling

## Components Implemented

### 1. Partitioner (`sabot/_cython/shuffle/partitioner.pyx`)

**Hash/Range/RoundRobin partitioning for Arrow RecordBatches**

- `HashPartitioner` - Hash-based key partitioning using Arrow compute functions
  - Algorithm: `partition_id = hash(key_columns) % num_partitions`
  - Uses MurmurHash3 for distribution
  - Supports single and multi-column keys
  - Target: >1M rows/sec partitioning throughput

- `RangePartitioner` - Range-based partitioning for sorted data
  - Binary search through partition boundaries
  - Useful for time-series or sorted datasets

- `RoundRobinPartitioner` - Stateless load balancing
  - Even distribution across partitions
  - No key columns required

**Key Features:**
- All operations on `CRecordBatch` (C++ level) for zero-copy
- Uses Arrow compute `hash()` and `take()` kernels
- Factory function `create_partitioner()` based on shuffle edge type

### 2. Shuffle Buffer (`sabot/_cython/shuffle/shuffle_buffer.pyx`)

**Memory management with Flink-style buffer pools**

- `ShuffleBuffer` - Per-partition buffer with auto-flush
  - Configurable thresholds: max_rows, max_bytes
  - Merges multiple batches on flush
  - Spill-to-disk support (via Tonbo)

- `NetworkBufferPool` - Global buffer pool
  - Fixed pool of 32KB buffers (configurable)
  - Exclusive buffers: 2 per partition (permanent)
  - Floating buffers: 8 per shuffle (shared pool)
  - Natural backpressure when exhausted

- `SpillManager` - Disk spillage for memory pressure
  - Spills batches to Arrow IPC files
  - Threshold-based triggering
  - Cleanup after consumption

**Key Features:**
- Flink-inspired buffer allocation strategy
- Thread-safe buffer pool with locks
- Automatic spill-to-disk via Arrow IPC
- Bounded memory usage prevents OOM

### 3. Shuffle Transport (`sabot/_cython/shuffle/shuffle_transport.pyx`)

**Arrow Flight-based zero-copy network layer**

- `ShuffleServer` - Serves shuffle partitions via Flight
  - Listens on configurable port (default 8816)
  - Path format: `/shuffle/{shuffle_id}/partition/{partition_id}`
  - Zero-copy streaming via Arrow IPC
  - Background thread for serving

- `ShuffleClient` - Fetches partitions via Flight
  - Connection pooling (reuse TCP connections)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Parallel fetching from multiple upstream tasks

- `ShuffleTransport` - Unified server+client
  - Each agent runs one ShuffleTransport
  - Publishes local shuffle outputs
  - Fetches remote shuffle inputs

**Key Features:**
- Leverages existing Sabot Flight infrastructure
- Zero-copy via Arrow IPC (serialization <1μs per batch)
- gRPC-based transport (built into Arrow Flight)
- All network operations in Cython (no Python overhead)

### 4. Shuffle Manager (`sabot/_cython/shuffle/shuffle_manager.pyx`)

**Coordinates all shuffle operations for an agent**

- Shuffle registration and lifecycle
- Partition buffer management
- Write-side: buffer + flush operations
- Read-side: fetch from upstream agents
- Task location tracking (N×M mappings)
- Integration with transport layer

**Key APIs:**
```python
# Register shuffle
shuffle_id = manager.register_shuffle(
    operator_id, num_partitions, partition_keys, edge_type, schema
)

# Write side (upstream tasks)
manager.write_partition(shuffle_id, partition_id, batch)
manager.flush_partition(shuffle_id, partition_id)

# Read side (downstream tasks)
batches = manager.read_partition(shuffle_id, partition_id, upstream_agents)
```

**Key Features:**
- Manages all shuffle metadata
- Coordinates N upstream × M downstream connections
- Automatic flush on buffer threshold
- Cleanup after shuffle complete

## Performance Targets

| Component | Target | Method |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Partitioning | >1M rows/sec | Cython + Arrow compute |
| Network | >100K rows/sec per partition | Arrow Flight zero-copy |
| Serialization | <1μs per batch | Arrow IPC (zero-copy) |
| Memory | Bounded by buffer pool | Fixed pool + backpressure |
| Latency | <5ms end-to-end | For 10KB batches |

## Design Decisions

1. **All Arrow IPC in C++/Cython** - Zero Python overhead for serialization/network
2. **Arrow Flight for transport** - Reuses existing infrastructure, gRPC + zero-copy
3. **Flink-style buffer pools** - Proven design for memory management + backpressure
4. **Tonbo for spilling** - Leverage existing vendored Tonbo C API
5. **Hash partitioning** - Deterministic key locality for stateful operators

## Integration with Execution Graph

### Shuffle Edge Types

```python
class ShuffleEdgeType:
    FORWARD = 0      # 1:1, no shuffle (operator chaining)
    HASH = 1         # Hash by key (joins, groupBy)
    BROADCAST = 2    # Replicate to all (small dimension tables)
    REBALANCE = 3    # Round-robin (load balance)
    RANGE = 4        # Range partition (sorted data)
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Define pipeline with operator parallelism
stream = (app.stream("transactions", parallelism=10)
    .map(enrich, parallelism=10)       # 10 map tasks
    .key_by("user_id")                 # ← Triggers HASH shuffle
    .window(tumbling(minutes=5))
    .aggregate(sum("amount"), parallelism=5)  # 5 aggregate tasks
    .sink(kafka_sink))

# Physical execution:
# 1. 10 map tasks produce data
# 2. Hash partition by user_id into 5 partitions
# 3. Network shuffle redistributes data (10×5 = 50 connections)
# 4. 5 aggregate tasks consume partitioned data
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/test_shuffle_partitioner.py`)

- Hash partitioner single/multiple keys
- Range partitioner with boundaries

### Step 2: Operator Integration

- Wire shuffle into execution graph generation

### Step 3: Execution Graph Integration

## Summary

Implemented complete shuffle system for Sabot with:
