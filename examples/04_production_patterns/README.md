## Patterns

### 1. **Stream Enrichment** ✅ **READY**

**Use case:** Enrich real-time events with reference data

**Examples:**
- Fintech: Enrich trades with security details
- E-commerce: Enrich orders with product catalog
- IoT: Enrich sensor readings with device metadata

**Pattern:**
```
Stream (quotes, orders, clicks)
    ↓
  [Join] ← Reference Table (securities, products, devices)
    ↓
Enriched Stream
```

**Files:**
- `stream_enrichment/distributed_enrichment.py` ✅ Ready
- `stream_enrichment/local_enrichment.py` (TODO)
- `stream_enrichment/README.md` ✅ Complete

**Performance:**
- Throughput: 48M rows/sec (distributed)
- Latency: 230ms for 1.2M events
- Optimization: 11x speedup with filter + projection pushdown

**Run:**
```bash
python examples/04_production_patterns/stream_enrichment/distributed_enrichment.py
```

### 2. **Fraud Detection** (TODO)

**Use case:** Real-time fraud detection with stateful pattern matching

**Patterns detected:**
- Velocity (too many transactions in short time)

**Pattern:**
```
Transactions
    ↓
  [Stateful Patterns]
    ↓
Fraud Alerts
```

**Files:**

- Count, sum, avg, percentiles
- Top-N rankings

**Pattern:**
```
Events
    ↓
  [Tumbling Window]
    ↓
  [Aggregate]
    ↓
Metrics
```

**Files:**
- `real_time_analytics/local_analytics.py` (TODO)
- `real_time_analytics/distributed_analytics.py` (TODO)

## When to Use Each Pattern

### Use Stream Enrichment When:

✅ You have streaming events + slowly-changing reference data
✅ You need to add context to events (product details, user profiles)
✅ Join is one-to-one or many-to-one
✅ Reference table fits in memory or can be distributed

**Examples:**
- Market data enrichment (quotes + securities)
- Order enrichment (orders + products)
- Click enrichment (clicks + user profiles)

---

### Use Fraud Detection When:

✅ You need to detect patterns across multiple events
✅ State needs to be maintained per entity (account, user, device)
✅ You need to correlate events in time windows
✅ Low-latency alerts are critical (<100ms)

**Examples:**
- Credit card fraud
- Account takeover detection
- Bot detection
- Suspicious activity monitoring

---

### Use Real-Time Analytics When:

✅ You need aggregated metrics over time windows
✅ Dashboards require real-time updates
✅ You need to compute percentiles, top-N, or rolling aggregates
✅ Late data handling is required

**Examples:**
- Real-time dashboards (sales, traffic, errors)
- SLA monitoring (latency p95, p99)
- Capacity planning (CPU, memory trends)
- Anomaly detection (unusual spikes)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Local Version

```bash
# Learn pattern locally first
python local_enrichment.py

# Then scale to distributed
python distributed_enrichment.py
```

**Why:** Easier to debug, faster iteration

### 2. Use Optimizer

```python
from sabot.compiler.plan_optimizer import PlanOptimizer

optimizer = PlanOptimizer()
optimized = optimizer.optimize(graph)
```

**Benefit:** 2-10x speedup automatic

### 3. Choose Right State Backend

| Backend | Use When | Max Size |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Memory | Hot paths, <1GB state | 1GB |
| Tonbo | Medium state, <100GB | 100GB |
| RocksDB | Large state, >100GB | 1TB+ |

### 4. Monitor Performance

```python
stats = optimizer.get_stats()
print(f"Optimizations: {stats.total_optimizations()}")

result = await job_manager.submit_job(optimized)
print(f"Execution time: {result['execution_time_ms']:.1f}ms")
```

---

## Combining Patterns

### Enrichment + Fraud Detection

```python
# 1. Enrich transactions with user profiles
enriched = enrich_stream(transactions, user_profiles)

# 2. Run fraud detection on enriched data
alerts = detect_fraud(enriched)
```

### Enrichment + Analytics

```python
# 1. Enrich events
enriched = enrich_stream(events, reference_data)

# 2. Aggregate metrics
metrics = compute_windowed_metrics(enriched, window_size='5min')
```

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Tested with local version
- [ ] Tested with distributed version
- [ ] Optimizer enabled
- [ ] Appropriate state backend chosen
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Scaling tested (2x, 5x, 10x load)
- [ ] Failure recovery tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Throughput

**Check:**
1. Optimizer enabled?
2. Enough agents?
3. Appropriate batch size?
4. Arrow format used?

**Solution:** Enable all optimizations, add more agents, increase batch size

### High Latency

**Check:**
1. Synchronous operations in hot path?
2. Large batches?
3. Slow network?

**Solution:** Use async operations, tune batch size, check network

### High Memory

**Check:**
1. Projection pushdown enabled?
2. State accumulation?
3. Large reference tables?

**Solution:** Enable projection pushdown, configure state TTL, distribute state

### Join Produces 0 Rows

**Check:**
1. Key mismatch?
2. Data type mismatch?
3. Empty input?

**Solution:** Verify keys match, check data types, validate input data
