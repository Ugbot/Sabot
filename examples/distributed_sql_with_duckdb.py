Distributed SQL Query Example with DuckDB Loader

Demonstrates:
1. Loading data from various sources using DuckDB's connectors (Parquet, CSV, Postgres, S3)
2. Distributing queries across multiple agents using SQL pipeline
3. Using Sabot's morsel-driven execution for parallel processing
4. Zero-copy Arrow integration throughout

This example shows the power of combining:
- DuckDB's excellent I/O and format support
- Sabot's distributed morsel-driven execution
- Zero-copy Arrow columnar processing

Key Takeaways:
--------------
1. DuckDB excels at I/O: Parquet, CSV, S3, Postgres, etc.
2. Automatic pushdown: Filters/projections pushed to storage
3. Zero-copy: Arrow batches flow without serialization
4. Distributed SQL: Queries span multiple agents with morsels
5. Best of both: DuckDB I/O + Sabot distributed execution

Performance Characteristics:
---------------------------
• Local mode: ~2x DuckDB standalone (optimizer overhead)
• Distributed mode: Linear scaling with agent count
• Zero-copy: No serialization bottleneck
• Morsel parallelism: Cache-friendly, SIMD-optimized

Use Cases:
----------
✓ Large-scale analytics on diverse data sources
✓ Federated queries across Parquet/CSV/Postgres/S3
✓ Real-time aggregation on streaming data
✓ ETL pipelines with distributed processing
