# Phase 3: Sabot Integration Complete

## Overview

Phase 3 successfully integrates the newly developed C++ streaming components into the broader Sabot distributed execution framework and Python API. This phase focuses on wiring streaming descriptors to Sabot execution, implementing checkpoint barrier injection, and enabling multi-partition parallelism for streaming execution.

## Completed Components

- `RecoverFromCheckpoint()` - Recover from previous checkpoint

### 3. StreamingAgentDistributor
**File**: `sabot_sql/include/sabot_sql/streaming/streaming_agent_distributor.h`
**File**: `sabot_sql/src/streaming/streaming_agent_distributor.cpp`

- **Purpose**: Manages distribution of streaming tasks across Sabot agents
- **Features**:
  - Agent registration and health monitoring
  - Partition assignment and rebalancing
  - Task deployment and execution coordination
  - Result collection and aggregation
  - Failure handling and recovery

**Key Methods**:
- `CreateDistributionPlan()` - Create partition distribution plan
- `DeployTasksToAgents()` - Deploy tasks to available agents
- `AssignPartitionToAgent()` - Assign specific partitions to agents
- `RebalancePartitions()` - Rebalance partitions across agents
- `AggregateResults()` - Aggregate results from multiple agents

## Architecture Integration

### Sabot Execution Framework Integration

The Phase 3 components integrate with Sabot's existing infrastructure:

1. **JobManager**: Coordinates overall job execution
2. **Agent**: Individual execution nodes
3. **TaskExecutor**: Executes individual tasks
4. **ParallelProcessor**: Handles morsel parallelism
5. **ShuffleTransport**: Manages data shuffling between operators

### MarbleDB State Management

All components use MarbleDB as the unified state store:

- **RAFT-replicated tables**: For dimension tables and connector offsets
- **Local tables**: For streaming state (window aggregates, join buffers)
- **Timer API**: For watermark triggers and checkpoint coordination
- **State operations**: `WriteState()` and `ReadState()` for general state management

### Checkpoint Coordination

Integration with Sabot's existing checkpoint system:

- **CheckpointCoordinator**: Manages distributed checkpoints
- **Barrier injection**: Chandy-Lamport algorithm implementation
- **State snapshots**: Atomic state capture across operators
- **Recovery**: Automatic recovery from checkpoints
