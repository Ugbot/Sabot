## Document Organization Principles

Documents are organized by:

1. **Purpose** (status, design, roadmap, results)
2. **Not by date** - dates are in filenames if relevant
3. **Not by completion** - use status tags instead

---

## Maintenance

This documentation folder is **historical and exploratory**. For authoritative information:

- **Current Status:** [README.md](../README.md)
- **Architecture:** [PROJECT_MAP.md](../PROJECT_MAP.md)
- **Incomplete Features:** [STUB_INVENTORY.md](../STUB_INVENTORY.md)

When creating new dev docs:
- Put status updates in `status/`
- Put designs in `design/`
- Put plans in `roadmap/`
- Put analysis in `results/`
- Update this index

## Key Insights from Dev Docs

### What Works (from status/)
- Cython checkpoint coordinator (<10μs barrier initiation)
- Memory state backend (1M+ ops/sec)
- Basic Kafka integration (3K-6K txn/s fraud demo)
- Stream API scaffolding

### What's In Progress (from status/)
- Agent runtime execution layer
- RocksDB state backend
- Arrow batch processing
- Distributed coordination

### What Needs Work (from stub inventory)
- Test coverage (~5%)
- Mock implementations in CLI
- Arrow integration (40+ stubs)
- Store backend completion
