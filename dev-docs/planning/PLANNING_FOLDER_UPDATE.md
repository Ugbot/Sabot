## Status Assessment

### Files Requiring Updates

#### 1. CURRENT_PRIORITIES.md (October 2 â†’ October 8)
**Status:** OUTDATED - Priorities from early October before Phases 1-4 completion

**Issues:**
- P0 priorities completed: âœ… Arrow core refactor, CLI/channel fixes
- P1 priorities partially complete: Agent runtime integration ongoing
- Documentation priorities addressed
- Arrow module decision made (use vendored Arrow)

**Updates Needed:**
- Mark P0 items as complete (Arrow core, CLI, channels)
- Update test coverage status (66 tests created for Phase 3)
- Update success metrics with actual October 8 progress
- Revise timeline based on Phases 1-4 completion

---

#### 2. IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (October 2 â†’ October 8)
**Status:** OUTDATED - Sequential plan from before Phase 1-4 completion

**Issues:**
- Phase 1-3 work completed (Batch operators, Numba, Morsels)
- Phase 4 (Network shuffle) complete
- Document reflects pre-implementation state
- Arrow integration completed differently than planned

**Updates Needed:**
- Mark Phases 1-4 as complete
- Update current state section
- Revise remaining phases based on actual progress
- Point to phase-specific implementation docs

---

#### 3. IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (October 6 â†’ October 8)
**Status:** MOSTLY CURRENT - Created Oct 6, accurate for Phases 1-7

**Issues:**
- Timeline estimates in hours (should be steps per CLAUDE.md)
- Reflects planning phase, not execution status
- Doesn't show Phase 1-4 completion

**Updates Needed:**
- Add completion status markers for Phases 1-4
- Update to show current execution state (70% functional)
- Remove hour estimates, use step-based progression

---

#### 4. IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (October 3 â†’ October 8)
**Status:** OUTDATED - Shows partial Phase 1-3 implementation

**Issues:**
- Shows Phase 1 as "COMPLETE" but dated October 3
- Phase 3 tests created but status shows "IN PROGRESS"
- Doesn't reflect Phases 1-4 completion
- Line count metrics from October 3

**Updates Needed:**
- Update completion status: Phases 1-4 complete
- Update test metrics (66 unit tests + Phase 3 tests)
- Update progress metrics (11% â†’ 70% functional)
- Remove outdated "Next Steps" section

---

#### 5. REALITY_CHECK_OCT2025.md (October 3)
**Status:** HISTORICAL - Good snapshot of October 3 status

**Action:** Mark as historical, keep for reference

---

#### 6. REALITY_CHECK.md (October 2)
**Status:** HISTORICAL - Good snapshot of October 2 status

**Action:** Mark as historical, keep for reference
