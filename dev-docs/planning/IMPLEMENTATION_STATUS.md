## Verified Metrics

### Actual Line Counts (measured 2025-10-03)
```
app.py:           1,950 lines
cli.py:           1,778 lines
arrow.py:           347 lines (stub with PyArrow fallback)
runtime.py:         657 lines
stream.py:          805 lines
```

**Note:** Previous documentation claimed 60K LOC total. Actual measurement needed with proper tool (cloc not installed).

## Implementation Status by Phase

### Phase 1: Critical Blockers ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] CLI app loading (already implemented)
- [x] Channel creation (already implemented)
- [ ] Tests for CLI (pending)
- [ ] Tests for channels (pending)

### Phase 2: Agent Runtime ⚠️ PARTIAL
- [ ] Wire agents to Kafka
- [ ] Connect state backends
- [ ] Integrate checkpoint coordinator
- **Status:** Runtime structure exists (657 lines) but execution incomplete

### Phase 3: Testing 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- [x] Checkpoint tests created (21 tests)
- [x] State backend tests created (27 tests)
- [x] Time/watermark tests created (18 tests)
- [ ] Arrow integration tests (pending)
- [ ] Fraud demo E2E test (pending)
- [ ] Run tests to verify they pass

### Phase 4-9: Not Started
- Phase 4: Stream API (windows/joins)
- Phase 5: Event-time processing
- Phase 6: Error handling & recovery
- Phase 7: Performance benchmarking
- Phase 8: Documentation updates
- Phase 9: Additional features

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (can run in parallel)
1. **Run created tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_cython_checkpoint.py -v
   pytest tests/unit/test_cython_state.py -v
   pytest tests/unit/test_cython_time.py -v
   ```

2. **Fix any test failures** - tests may need imports adjusted

3. **Create remaining Phase 3 tests:**
   - Arrow integration tests
   - Fraud demo E2E test

### Phase 2 (critical path)
Must complete before most other work:
- Implement agent-to-Kafka wiring per PHASE2_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Connect state backends to agent runtime
- Integrate checkpoint coordinator

### Documentation (can run anytime)
- Update PROJECT_MAP.md with verified file sizes
- Update README.md with accurate claims
- Create ARROW_STATUS.md comprehensive analysis

---

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# All new unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_cython_*.py -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_cython_*.py --cov=sabot.checkpoint --cov=sabot.state --cov=sabot.time --cov-report=html

# Performance benchmarks only
pytest tests/unit/test_cython_*.py -v -m benchmark --benchmark-only
```

### Expected Results
- Checkpoint barrier latency: <10μs
- Memory state GET/PUT: >1M ops/sec
- Watermark update: <5μs
- All unit tests pass

---

## Known Issues

### Tests May Need Adjustment
Created tests assume imports work like:
```python
from sabot.checkpoint import Barrier, BarrierTracker, Coordinator
from sabot.state import MemoryBackend, ValueState, ListState
from sabot.time import WatermarkTracker, Timers
```

If imports fail, check actual module structure and adjust.

### Missing Test Dependencies
Some tests may require:
- pytest-benchmark (for performance tests)
- pytest-asyncio (for async tests)
- tempfile, shutil (stdlib, should work)

Install if needed:
```bash
pip install pytest-benchmark pytest-asyncio
```
