# Phase 8: Documentation & Cleanup - Technical Specification

**Phase:** 8 of 9
**Focus:** Align all documentation with ground truth
**Dependencies:** Phases 1-7 (implementation and testing complete)
**Goal:** Honest, accurate documentation reflecting actual implementation status

---

## Overview

Phase 8 brings all documentation into alignment with the actual codebase. After discovering massive discrepancies between claimed and actual implementation status, this phase ensures honest representation.

**Key Issues Found:**
- LOC count inflated 7.5x (claimed 60K, actual ~8K)
- Arrow module completely stubbed (32 NotImplementedError)
- Many features marked "working" are actually stubs
- Vendored Arrow claimed but doesn't exist

**Goal:**
- Document all stubs clearly
- Update all LOC counts with verified measurements
- Remove misleading performance claims
- Mark experimental vs production-ready components

## Step 8.1: Document sabot/arrow.py Status

See PHASE8 agent output for complete details on documenting Arrow status.

---

## Step 8.2: Update README.md

Update README with honest capability claims and verified metrics.

---

## Step 8.3: Update PROJECT_MAP.md  

Replace all file sizes with cloc-verified measurements.

---

## Step 8.4: Update CLAUDE.md

Add implementation verification guidelines.
