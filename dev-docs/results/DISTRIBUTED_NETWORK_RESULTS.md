- Serves data via Arrow Flight (gRPC protocol)
- Port: 8815
- Role: Data provider

**Node 2: Join Client**
- Loads quotes locally from Arrow IPC file
- Fetches securities from remote Flight server
- Performs hash join locally
- Calculates spreads and aggregations
- Role: Data processor

**Communication:** Arrow Flight over gRPC (zero-copy network transfer)

## Performance Analysis

### Breakdown by Operation

| Operation | Time | Throughput | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|
| **Load quotes (local)** | 54ms | 22.3M rows/sec | ArrowIPCReader streaming |
| **Load securities (server)** | 2.3s | 4.3M rows/sec | ArrowIPCReader on Node 1 |
| **Network fetch (Flight)** | 35.5s | 0.3M rows/sec | 7.3GB over gRPC |
| **Hash join (local)** | 7.2s | 1.6M rows/sec | PyArrow filter join |
| **Spread calc (local)** | 5.6ms | Fast | Arrow compute |
| **Total pipeline** | **45s** | **0.25M rows/sec** | **All operations** |

### What Dominates Runtime?

**Network Transfer: 79% of total time (35.5s)**
- Fetching 10M securities from remote server
- 7.3GB transfer over local network (gRPC)
- Throughput: 206 MB/s (7.3GB in 35.5s)

**Local Processing: 21% of total time (9.5s)**
- Hash join: 7.2s (76% of processing)
- Load quotes: 54ms (0.6% of processing)
- Spread calc: 5.6ms (0.06% of processing)

**Bottleneck:** Network data transfer (35.5s for 7.3GB)

## Network Performance

### Arrow Flight Throughput

**1M Records Test:**
- Size: 734MB
- Transfer time: 448ms
- **Throughput: 1.6 GB/s** ‚ö°

**10M Records Test:**
- Size: 7.3GB
- Transfer time: 35.5s
- **Throughput: 206 MB/s**

**Observation:** Throughput degrades with larger transfers (1.6GB/s ‚Üí 206MB/s)
- Likely due to: gRPC flow control, buffer management, GC pressure
- Still respectable for untuned network I/O

### vs Local Loading

**Local ArrowIPCReader:**
- 10M rows: 2.3s (4.3M rows/sec)
- Direct file read from disk

**Network Arrow Flight:**
- 10M rows: 35.5s (0.3M rows/sec)
- **15x slower** than local disk

**Trade-off:** Network adds latency but enables distributed processing

---

## Distributed Join Performance

### Join Characteristics

**Input:**
- 10M securities (remote, fetched via Flight)
- 1.2M quotes (local)
- Total: 11.2M rows

**Output:**
- 392,411 enriched rows (35% of quotes matched)

**Performance:**
- Join time: 7.2s
- Throughput: 1.6M rows/sec
- Method: PyArrow filter (set membership check)

**vs Single-Node (E2E_ENRICHMENT_RESULTS.md):**
- Single-node join: 82.4ms (135.9M rows/sec)
- Distributed join: 7.2s (1.6M rows/sec)
- **87x slower** (due to Python fallback loop)

**Why slower?**
- PyArrow join fails on null columns ‚Üí fallback to Python loop
- Distributed data fetch adds latency
- No native Arrow join optimization in distributed case

---

## Comparison: Single-Node vs Distributed

### Single-Node (Local, from E2E_ENRICHMENT_RESULTS.md)

```
Total: 2.28s for 11.2M rows
- Load securities: 2.12s (local disk)
- Load quotes: 54.6ms (local disk)
- Hash join: 82.4ms (in-memory)
- Processing: 11ms
```

**Throughput: 4.9M rows/sec**

### Distributed (Two-Node Network)

```
Total: 45s for 11.2M rows
- Load securities (server): 2.3s (local disk)
- Fetch securities (network): 35.5s (Flight/gRPC)
- Load quotes (client): 54ms (local disk)
- Hash join: 7.2s (in-memory)
- Processing: 5.6ms
```

**Throughput: 0.25M rows/sec**

**Overhead:** 20x slower due to network transfer (35.5s network vs 2.12s disk)

## Architecture Insights

### What Works Well ‚úÖ

1. **Arrow Flight Integration**
   - gRPC-based zero-copy network transfer
   - Schema preservation across network
   - RecordBatch streaming works correctly

2. **ArrowIPCReader on Both Nodes**
   - Fast local loading (4.3M - 22.3M rows/sec)
   - Streaming with early termination
   - Consistent performance across nodes

3. **Distributed Architecture**
   - Server/client model functional
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Easy to reason about data flow

### What Needs Work ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Network Transfer Performance**
   - 206 MB/s for large transfers (could be 1-10 GB/s)
   - Possible optimizations:
     - Batch size tuning
     - Compression (LZ4/Zstd)
     - Connection pooling
     - Parallel batch fetch

2. **Join Performance**
   - Python fallback is slow (7.2s vs 82ms)
   - Need to fix null column handling for native Arrow join
   - Should use Sabot's cyarrow hash_join_batches

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Currently single server/single client
   - Need: Multiple workers, partitioned data, parallel fetch

## Use Cases

### When to Use Distributed

‚úÖ **Good fit:**
- Data too large for single machine memory
- Need to scale horizontally (multiple nodes)
- Data locality matters (reduce data movement)
- Different nodes have different data sources

‚ùå **Not ideal:**
- Small datasets that fit in memory (<10GB)
- Low-latency requirements (<100ms)
- Network bandwidth is limited
- Single-machine can handle the workload

**Current test:** 11.2M rows, 7.3GB ‚Üí Better suited for single-node (2.28s vs 45s)

**Sweet spot:** 100M+ rows, 100GB+ data, data partitioned across nodes

---

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Optimize Network Transfer
- [ ] Implement compression (LZ4/Zstd) on Flight
- [ ] Parallel batch fetching (multiple Flight clients)
- [ ] Tune batch sizes for network transfer
- **Expected improvement:** 5-10x faster (35.5s ‚Üí 4-7s)

### Priority 2: Fix Join Performance
- [ ] Remove null columns before join (preprocessing)
- [ ] Use Sabot's native cyarrow hash_join_batches
- [ ] Implement distributed join (shuffle-based)
- **Expected improvement:** 50-100x faster (7.2s ‚Üí 70-140ms)

### Priority 3: Multi-Node Scaling
- [ ] Test with 3+ nodes
- [ ] Implement data partitioning (hash/range)
- [ ] Add shuffle manager integration
- [ ] Test task slot elasticity

### Priority 4: Task Slot Integration
- [ ] Integrate TaskSlotManager with Flight servers
- [ ] Morsel-driven parallel processing across nodes
- [ ] Dynamic work stealing between nodes
