## Optimizations Applied

1. **Columnar Processing**
   - Arrow RecordBatch format
   - SIMD operations on columns
   - Minimal Python object creation

2. **Batch Processing**
   - 10,000-50,000 rows per batch
   - Amortizes overhead
   - Optimizes cache usage

3. **Zero-Copy Operations**
   - Slicing without copying
   - Column selection without copying
   - Filter results share buffers

4. **Lazy Evaluation**
   - Stream operations don't execute until `.collect()`
   - Allows optimization of entire pipeline
   - Reduces intermediate allocations
