avoid unnecessary memory allocations; prefer memory pooling and reuse buffers where possible.
do not use exceptions for control flow or error handling in C++ code; return error codes instead.
follow project directory and layout conventions strictly—respect boundaries between modules and layers.
do not mock dependencies outside of test code.
prefer vectorized (SIMD-friendly) algorithms and minimize data copies for performance.
Dont rush, get it right.
Dont simulate a response, build the real version.
TODOS and stubs are not allowed unless asked. just build the real thing.
we are not worried about token use, just get things correct.
performance requires correctness
