Arrow Flight Client - Zero-Copy Network Transport

Provides high-performance client for receiving RecordBatches over the network.
Uses Arrow Flight's zero-copy IPC protocol for maximum throughput.

Performance targets:
- Deserialization: ~1μs per batch (zero-copy)
- Network throughput: Limited by network bandwidth, not CPU
- Latency: <1ms end-to-end for small batches
