- dont simplfy thigns to get a fix as that makes it harder to get it right in the long run. refactor and clarify only
- we always prefer using Cython to python for perfomance critical code in streaming libraries
- if  we are vendoring a library that has cython bindings we should use the cython directly rather than go in via ptyhon.
- use the vendored librarys over hte ones from pip (arrow, tonbo, rocksdb)
- always use our version of arrow, not one from pip
- use UV for all venv and pip stuff
- check @PROJECT_MAP.md  before working on somthing and udpate it afterwards
- always use local arrow.
- in planning and roadmap docs, dont use time just steps in order.
- be accurate not optimistic about statements of progress. also there is no need to bash previous statements just corrrect them
- this is professional project, avoid emotion in descriptions.
- any time we are testing sabot it  has to use cyarrow not pyarrow.
- the goal is to build an intergrated system so a user does not need a million imports. sabot should feel like one thing not a box of bits.
- tests live in the test folder.
- we build arrow and use our own. we do not import the system arrow ever
