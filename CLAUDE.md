- dont simplfy thigns to get a fix as that makes it harder to get it right in the long run. refactor and clarify only
- we always prefer using Cython to python for perfomance critical code in streaming libraries
- if  we are vendoring a library that has cython bindings we should use the cython directly rather than go in via ptyhon.
- use the vendored librarys over hte ones from pip (arrow, tonbo, rocksdb)
- always use our version of arrow, not one from pip
- use UV for all venv and pip stuff
