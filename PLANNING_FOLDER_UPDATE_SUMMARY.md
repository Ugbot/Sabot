## Impact

### Before Update
- ‚ùå Planning docs from October 2-3 showed 20-25% functional
- ‚ùå Didn't reflect Phases 1-4 completion
- ‚ùå No clear current planning source
- ‚ùå Outdated priorities and status

### After Update
- ‚úÖ Accurate current status (70% functional)
- ‚úÖ Phases 1-4 marked complete
- ‚úÖ Clear current planning document (IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
- ‚úÖ Historical documents preserved with context
- ‚úÖ Cross-references updated
- ‚úÖ Timeline reflects Q4 2025 reality

3. Update planning docs monthly (next: November 8, 2025)
4. Archive very old planning docs (optional)

**For Development Work:**
- Current priorities: Complete Phases 5-6
- Current planning: IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
- Current roadmap: CURRENT_ROADMAP_OCT2025.md
- Phase details: dev-docs/implementation/PHASE*.md
